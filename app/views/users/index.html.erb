<h1>Users</h1>

<p>
  Users is the baseline model for the database-persisted wizard approach. Every time someone hits 'new'
  a new (empty) record is created in the database and the user is redirected to the steps controller
  nested inside that unique resource's URL. This is a very straightforward approach, tried and true.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Turbo Drive has been specifically disabled for this wizard just to ensure a fully-baseline operation.
  It is enabled in the Boats wizard and beyond. For each step in this wizard you should see your browser's
  native loading bar run on each step's submit button.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Aside from the risk of runaway database record creation, this baseline approach can muddy up your
  development experience since any given MyModel.last could actually be in incomplete model. We attempt
  to resolve this issue in later examples with default_scopes and etc, but we cannot escape the reality
  that each time the wizard is executed, a new database record is created; a new primary key ID is used.
  That side effect and this approach should be carefully considered before use in a very-high-traffic
  environemnt, especially those that have no User object / authentication to correlate records to.
