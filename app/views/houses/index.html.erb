<h1>Houses</h1>

<p>
  Houses is the model we're using for a cache-persisted multi-step form that also implements Turbo
  Frames to create a really nice SPA-like experience. Since we're using cache persistence we won't
  need to worry about partial objects in the database, the ActiveRecord/DB Record will only be created
  once the full wizard has been completed.

  <br/>
  <br/>

  On an opinion level, this feels like the direction Rails apps should go in. Turbo Frames make the UI
  workflow very quick and smooth while keeping all validations server-side and not littering the
  database with partially-completed records.

  <br/>
  <br/>

  The only downside here is that it requires Rails Cache to be enabled during development, which isn't
  necessarily the most "Railsy" thing — your cache should ultimately be dispensible and your application
  should work 100% functionally without it — it should purely be a transparent performance booster for the
  Rails app. Manifesting application logic (even if it's just letting consumers 'borrow' a little cache
  space for their mid-wizard form fields) into the Rails cache is generally frowned upon. While not
  technically breaking MVC since we're not persisting a model via the cache, the dependency on the cache
  for the system to operate properly has a notable impact. Please take time to assess that impact for your
  specific use-case.
