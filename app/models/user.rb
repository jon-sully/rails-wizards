# Heavily inspired by https://www.joshmcarthur.com/2014/12/23/rails-multistep-forms.html

# This example model shows the multi-step form _without_ Turbo Frames but on a project with
# hotwire installed, you need to add data: { turbo: false } to the form_with as to avoid turbo
# intercepting the requests.

# âœ… TODO: Still want to figure out some kind of scoping for once the model is totally validated.
#   could be a callback for marking some extra field "complete: true" if valid? âœ…
# âœ… TODO: any way to restrict a user's ability to reach the multi-step form if the object
#   is already complete? Not sure I want that but would like to know => Add an .update!(completed: true)
#   to the finish_wizard_path. This is way better than the callback before_save to validate against when
#   form_step is nil.
# âœ… TODO: Make another workflow that actually uses Turbo Frames for SPA-like experience
